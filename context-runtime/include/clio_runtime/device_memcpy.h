/**
 * Device-aware memcpy hook.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *
 *   The bdev runtime's WriteToRam / ReadFromRam / WriteToFile /
 *   ReadFromFile handlers receive a `data` ShmPtr that was filled in by
 *   the original PutBlob / GetBlob caller. With the SYCL build, that
 *   caller is sometimes a GPU kernel that allocated its data buffer in
 *   device USM (sycl::malloc_device) — i.e. an HBM-resident pointer
 *   the CPU cannot dereference with a plain memcpy. The bdev needs to
 *   route those copies through the SYCL queue (sycl::queue::memcpy)
 *   which dispatches based on USM pointer kind.
 *
 *   The bdev runtime is built without -fsycl (precompiled-headers
 *   conflict with the offload bundler), so it cannot call SYCL APIs
 *   directly. Instead, the SYCL init code (gpu/gpu2cpu_init_sycl.cc,
 *   which IS built with -fsycl) installs a function pointer here at
 *   ServerInit time. Bdev calls `chi::DeviceAwareMemcpy(...)`, which
 *   uses the hook when set and falls back to std::memcpy otherwise.
 *
 *   Setting the hook is single-threaded (server init), reading is
 *   single-threaded per task (workers don't race the hook itself).
 *   The atomic load is for visibility, not contention.
