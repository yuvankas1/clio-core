# repair_wheel.sh - Fix RPATHs and repack wheel for cibuildwheel
#
# Called by CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_LINUX in place of auditwheel repair.
# auditwheel doesn't work well with our bundled shared libraries, so we
# fix RPATHs to use $ORIGIN and repack preserving Unix permissions.
# We then use `wheel tags` to apply the correct manylinux platform tag.
#
# Usage (called by cibuildwheel):
#   bash repair_wheel.sh {dest_dir} {wheel}

# NOTE: Deliberately do NOT patchelf executables in iowarp_core/bin/.
#
# The manylinux container ships patchelf 0.15 from yum, which has a known
# bug where rewriting the dynamic section on certain manylinux-gcc-built
# binaries inserts a malformed extra RW PT_LOAD segment.  The ELF loader
# then crashes inside dl_main with SEGV_ACCERR before main() runs (see
# iowarp/clio-core#429).  The bug is reproducible against
# clio_run_thrpt_bench but not against the smaller binaries — likely a
# corner of patchelf 0.15 triggered by binaries with more NEEDED entries.
#
# Patching executables is also unnecessary for our use case: every binary
# in iowarp_core/bin/ is invoked through a [project.scripts] entry point
# whose Python wrapper (iowarp_core._cli._exec_iowarp_bin) sets
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH to <pkg>/lib before exec'ing the binary.  So $ORIGIN-
# relative RPATH would be redundant.
#
# Shared libraries (lib/, ext/) are still patched above because Python
# loads .so files directly without going through our wrapper, so they
# need RPATH to find their sibling .so dependencies.
