# IOWarp Core - Unified Development Guide

This repository contains the unified IOWarp Core framework, integrating multiple components:
- **context-transport-primitives** (formerly cte-hermes-shm): Core transport and shared memory primitives
- **runtime**: IOWarp runtime system
- **context-transfer-engine**: Context transfer engine
- **context-assimilation-engine**: Context assimilation engine
- **context-exploration-engine**: Context exploration engine

## Documentation Updates
Whenever you modify the configurations for context-runtime, context-transfer-engine, context-assimilation-engine, or bdev, we should update our documentation accordingly.
First, we should update context-runtime/config/chimaera_default.yaml to have the default parameters -- even just as comments. We should document the parameter options here as well.

After this, we need to update the following doc:
docs/docs/deployment/configuration.md

## Testing Updates

Never ever re-run tasks without installing your chanages first.
You need sudo if you are in the container.
We use rpaths for libraries. This stuff does not get overriden by LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

## Chimods

When building chimods, make sure to edit chimaera_mod.yaml and chimaera_repo.yaml.

If you add new methods to a chimod, please edit chimaera_mod.yaml and use the chimaera repo refresh binary to autogenerate the relevant autogen files.


## ⚠️ CRITICAL BUILD RULE ⚠️

**NEVER HARDCODE ABSOLUTE PATHS INSIDE THE CMAKES**

**NEVER BUILD OUTSIDE OF THE BUILD DIRECTORY. DO NOT PLACE BUILD FILES IN SOURCE DIRECTORIES. NEVER EVER EVER.**

### What This Means:

**NEVER do any of the following:**
- ❌ `rm -rf /workspace/build/*` followed by `cmake ..` (creates in-source build)
- ❌ Building third-party libraries in `/workspace` or any subdirectory
- ❌ Running cmake commands that create `CMakeFiles/`, `CMakeCache.txt`, or `Makefile` in source directories
- ❌ Creating `/tmp/build_*` directories for third-party dependencies and leaving them

**ALWAYS do this:**
- ✅ Build third-party libraries in a SEPARATE directory completely outside `/workspace` (e.g., `~/builds/libpressio`)
- ✅ Keep `/workspace/build` intact - use `cmake ..` from within it to reconfigure
- ✅ Clean build artifacts: `cd /workspace/build && make clean` (NOT `rm -rf /workspace/build/*`)
- ✅ Remove temporary build directories after installation: `rm -rf ~/builds/*`

**If you accidentally create build artifacts in source directories:**
1. Immediately stop
2. Remove ALL CMakeFiles, CMakeCache.txt, cmake_install.cmake, Makefile from source tree
3. Rebuild properly from `/workspace/build`

## Code Style

Keeep code simple. Do not allow functions to be more than 100 lines of code. Make helper functions logically.

Use the Google C++ style guide for C++.

You should store the pointer returned by the singleton GetInstance method. Avoid dereferencing GetInstance method directly using either -> or *. E.g., do not do ``hshm::Singleton<T>::GetInstance()->var_``. You should do ``auto *x = hshm::Singleton<T>::GetInstance(); x->var_;``.

Whenever you build a new function, always create a docstring for it. It should document what the parameters mean and the point of the function. It should be something easily parsed by doxygen.

### GPU Compiler Macro Rule

**NEVER** use raw GPU compiler-detection macros (`__CUDACC__`, `__HIPCC__`, `__HIP__`, `__CUDA_ARCH__`, `__HIP_DEVICE_COMPILE__`) anywhere except `context-transport-primitives/include/hermes_shm/constants/macros.h`. We do not want code paths to compile just because a GPU compiler is being used — we need the explicit CMake build flags (`HSHM_ENABLE_CUDA`, `HSHM_ENABLE_ROCM`) to be set as well.

**Use these macros instead:**
- `HSHM_IS_GPU` — true when compiling device code (replaces `__CUDA_ARCH__` / `__HIP_DEVICE_COMPILE__`)
- `HSHM_IS_HOST` — true when compiling host code
- `HSHM_IS_GPU_COMPILER` — true when compiled by nvcc or hipcc AND the build flag is set (replaces `__CUDACC__` / `__HIPCC__`)
- `HSHM_IS_CUDA_COMPILER` — CUDA-specific compiler check (replaces `HSHM_ENABLE_CUDA && __CUDACC__`)
- `HSHM_IS_ROCM_COMPILER` — ROCm-specific compiler check (replaces `HSHM_ENABLE_ROCM && __HIPCC__`)

## File Headers

All C/C++ source files (.h, .hpp, .cc, .cpp) MUST include the IOWarp BSD 3-Clause license header at the top of the file.

**Header Template:**
```c

```

**When creating new files:**
- Include the full BSD 3-Clause header at the top
- Use the template from `.header_template` or copy from existing files
- Place the header before any `#include` statements

**Updating existing files:**
Use the automated script:
```bash
./update_headers.sh --dry-run    # Preview changes
./update_headers.sh              # Apply changes
```

**Files to exclude:**
- Autogenerated files (matching `*autogen*`, `*_generated.*`, `*.pb.*`)
- Third-party code in `third_party/`, `external/`, `_deps/`
- Build artifacts

See `HEADER_UPDATE_GUIDE.md` for complete documentation.

NEVER use a null pool query. If you don't know, always use local.

Local QueueId should be named. NEVER use raw integers. This is the same for priorities. Please name them semantically.

All timing prints MUST include units of measurement in milliseconds (ms). Always print timing values in the order of milliseconds.

## Shared Memory Cleanup

### Automatic IPC Cleanup on RuntimeInit

When Chimaera RuntimeInit is called (via `IpcManager::ServerInit()`), it automatically cleans up leftover shared memory segments from previous runs or crashed processes by calling `IpcManager::ClearUserIpcs()`.

**ClearUserIpcs() Behavior:**
- Scans the per-user chimaera directory (`SystemInfo::GetMemfdDir()`, i.e. `/tmp/chimaera_$USER/`)
- Removes all memfd symlinks and IPC socket files from that directory
- Silently ignores permission errors (EACCES, EPERM) to support multi-user systems
- Other users' active Chimaera processes are not affected
- Logs successfully removed segments at kDebug level
- Returns the count of segments removed

This ensures a clean state for each runtime initialization without requiring manual cleanup scripts.

### IPC Path Convention

**CRITICAL**: Never hardcode `/tmp/chimaera_*` paths in IpcManager or elsewhere. Always use the `SystemInfo` helpers:
- `hshm::SystemInfo::GetMemfdDir()` — returns `/tmp/chimaera_$USER`
- `hshm::SystemInfo::GetMemfdPath(name)` — returns `/tmp/chimaera_$USER/<name>` (strips leading `/`)
- `hshm::SystemInfo::EnsureMemfdDir()` — creates the directory if it doesn't exist

For IPC Unix domain socket paths, use: `hshm::SystemInfo::GetMemfdPath("chimaera_" + std::to_string(port) + ".ipc")`

## Workflow

Use the incremental logic builder agent when making code changes.

Use the compiler subagent for making changes to cmakes and identifying places that need to be fixed in the code.

Always verify that code continue to compiles after making changes. Avoid commenting out code to fix compilation issues.

Whenever building unit tests, make sure to use the unit testing agent.

Whenever performing filesystem queries or executing programs, use the filesystem ops script agent.

NEVER DO MOCK CODE OR STUB CODE UNLESS SPECIFICALLY STATED OTHERWISE. ALWAYS IMPLEMENT REAL, WORKING CODE.

## Build Configuration

### Dependency Management Strategy

**IMPORTANT**: The Docker devcontainer uses **apt + source builds** for all dependencies. Conda is reserved for CI-only installer paths (`installers/conda/`).

**In the Devcontainer:**
- All dependencies are installed via apt or built from source in `deps-cpu.Dockerfile`
- A Python virtual environment is auto-activated at `/home/iowarp/venv`
- CMake finds packages via standard `/usr/local` and `/usr` paths
- Do NOT use conda in the devcontainer — it is not configured there

**Outside the Devcontainer:**
- Option 1 (Recommended): Run `install.sh` to build dependencies from source
- Option 2: Use system packages via apt
- Option 3: Use conda via `installers/conda/` recipes

**ADIOS2:**
- ADIOS2 is built from source to ensure C++20 compatibility
- Uses ADIOS2 v2.11.0 which supports both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures
- Built with MPI, HDF5, and ZeroMQ support
- SST is disabled due to ARM64 Linux compatibility issues in the DILL library

### Component Build Options
The unified IOWarp Core build system provides options to enable/disable components:
- `WRP_CORE_ENABLE_RUNTIME`: Enable runtime component (default: ON)
- `WRP_CORE_ENABLE_CTE`: Enable context-transfer-engine component (default: ON)
- `WRP_CORE_ENABLE_CAE`: Enable context-assimilation-engine component (default: ON)
- `WRP_CORE_ENABLE_CEE`: Enable context-exploration-engine component (default: ON)

Example:
```bash
cmake --preset=debug -DWRP_CORE_ENABLE_CTE=ON -DWRP_CORE_ENABLE_CAE=OFF
```

### Compilation Standards
- Always use the debug CMakePreset when compiling code in this repo
- Never hardcode paths in CMakeLists.txt files
- Use find_package() for all dependencies
- Follow ChiMod build patterns from MODULE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
- All compilation warnings have been resolved as of the current state

### RPATH Configuration
The build system uses **relative RPATHs** (`$ORIGIN`) for portable, relocatable binaries (enabled by default):
- **Enable/Disable**: Controlled by `WRP_CORE_ENABLE_RPATH` option (default: ON)
- **Linux**: Uses `$ORIGIN` and `$ORIGIN/../lib` so libraries and binaries find siblings at runtime
- **macOS**: Uses `@loader_path` and `@loader_path/../lib` (equivalent to `$ORIGIN`)
- Works for all deployment targets: system installs, pip wheels, conda packages, and relocatable builds
- **Disable RPATH**: Set `-DWRP_CORE_ENABLE_RPATH=OFF` if you prefer using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

### HSHM Usage

Always use HSHM_MCTX macro unless we are writing GPU code, which necessitates a specific mctx to be created.

### ChiMod Build Patterns

This project follows the Chimaera MODULE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md patterns for proper ChiMod development:

**Required Packages for ChiMod Development:**
```cmake
# Core Chimaera framework (includes ChimaeraCommon.cmake functions)
find_package(chimaera REQUIRED)              # Core library (chimaera::cxx)
find_package(chimaera_admin REQUIRED)        # Admin ChiMod (required for most ChiMods)
```

**ChiMod Creation Pattern:**
```cmake
# Use modern ChiMod build functions instead of manual add_library
add_chimod_runtime(
  CHIMOD_NAME core
  SOURCES
    src/core_runtime.cc
    src/core_config.cc
    src/autogen/core_lib_exec.cc
)

add_chimod_client(
  CHIMOD_NAME core
  SOURCES
    src/core_client.cc
    src/content_transfer_engine.cc
)
```

**Target Naming:**
- **Actual Targets**: `${NAMESPACE}_${CHIMOD_NAME}_runtime`, `${NAMESPACE}_${CHIMOD_NAME}_client`
- **CMake Aliases**: `${NAMESPACE}::${CHIMOD_NAME}_runtime`, `${NAMESPACE}::${CHIMOD_NAME}_client` (recommended)
- **Package Names**: `${NAMESPACE}_${CHIMOD_NAME}` (for external find_package)

## Worker Method Return Types

The following Worker methods return `void`, not `bool`:
- `ExecTask()` - Execute task with context switching capability
- `EndTask()` - End task execution and perform cleanup
- `RerouteDynamicTask()` - End dynamic scheduling task and re-route with updated pool query

These methods handle task execution flow internally and do not return success/failure status.

## PoolManager Coroutine Methods

The following PoolManager methods are coroutines that return `TaskResume`:
- `CreatePool()` - Creates a pool and co_awaits the container's Create method
- `DestroyPool()` - Destroys a pool (coroutine for consistency)

**Why Coroutines:**
These methods are coroutines to properly handle nested pool creation. When a ChiMod's Create method (e.g., CTE Create) needs to create sub-pools (e.g., bdev for storage), it uses `co_await`. The coroutine chain allows proper suspension and resumption:
1. Admin's `GetOrCreatePool` co_awaits `PoolManager::CreatePool`
2. `PoolManager::CreatePool` co_awaits `container->Run()` (the Create method)
3. The Create method can co_await nested pool creations (e.g., bdev Create)
4. When nested operations complete, the chain resumes automatically

**Admin Runtime Methods:**
The following admin runtime methods are also coroutines:
- `GetOrCreatePool()` - co_awaits PoolManager::CreatePool
- `DestroyPool()` - co_awaits PoolManager::DestroyPool
- `Destroy()` - co_awaits DestroyPool (alias)

## Task Wait and Future Pattern

### Task::Wait() Signature and Usage

`Task::Wait()` takes an `is_complete` reference parameter from the Future object:

```cpp
void Task::Wait(std::atomic<u32>& is_complete, double block_time_us = 0.0);
```

**Key Points:**
- Task::Wait() checks the `is_complete` flag from Future, not internal task state
- The method yields execution in a loop until `is_complete` is set to 1
- In runtime mode, uses cooperative multitasking with blocked queue mechanism
- In client mode, busy-waits on the `is_complete` flag with yielding

**Correct Usage Pattern:**
```cpp
// From IpcManager::Recv()
template <typename TaskT> void Recv(Future<TaskT>& future) {
  auto& future_shm = future.GetFutureShm();
  TaskT* task_ptr = future.get();
  task_ptr->Wait(future_shm->is_complete_);  // Pass future's is_complete flag
  // ... deserialization logic ...
}
```

**User-Facing API:**
Users should call `Future::Wait()` instead of `Task::Wait()` directly:
```cpp
auto task = client.AsyncCreate(/* ... */);
task.Wait();  // Calls IpcManager::Recv() which calls Task::Wait()
```

### Task::Yield() for Cooperative Yielding

`Task::Yield()` is used for cooperative yielding during blocking operations (I/O, locks, etc.) without waiting for a specific completion condition:

```cpp
void Task::Yield(double block_time_us = 0.0);
```

**Usage Examples:**
- CoMutex lock contention: `task->Yield();`
- Async I/O polling: `task->Yield();`
- Admin flush waiting: `task->Yield(25);`

**Implementation:**
- Adds task to blocked queue with specified blocking duration
- Yields execution back to worker
- Does NOT track subtask completion (unlike Wait)

## Type Aliases

Use the `WorkQueue` typedef for worker queue types:
```cpp
using WorkQueue = chi::ipc::mpsc_ring_buffer<hipc::TypedPointer<TaskLane>>;
```

This simplifies code readability and maintenance for worker queue operations.

**TaskLane Typedef:**
The `TaskLane` typedef is defined globally in the `chi` namespace:
```cpp
using TaskLane = chi::ipc::multi_mpsc_ring_buffer<hipc::TypedPointer<Task>, TaskQueueHeader>::queue_t;
```

Use `TaskLane*` for all lane pointers in RunContext and other interfaces. Avoid `void*` and explicit type casts.

## ChiMod Client Requirements

### PoolQuery Recommendations for Create Operations

**RECOMMENDED**: Use `PoolQuery::Dynamic()` for all Create operations to leverage automatic caching optimization.

**Dynamic Pool Query Behavior:**
- Routes to the Monitor method with `MonitorModeId::kGlobalSchedule`
- Monitor performs a two-step process:
  1. Check if pool exists locally using PoolManager
  2. If pool exists: change pool_query to Local (task executes locally using existing pool)
  3. If pool doesn't exist: change pool_query to Broadcast (task creates pool on all nodes)
- This optimization avoids unnecessary network overhead when pools already exist locally

**Correct Usage:**
```cpp
// Recommended: Use Dynamic() for automatic caching
admin_client.Create(mctx, chi::PoolQuery::Dynamic(), "admin");
bdev_client.Create(mctx, chi::PoolQuery::Dynamic(), file_path, chimaera::bdev::BdevType::kFile);
```

### CreateTask Pool Assignment
CreateTask operations in all ChiMod clients MUST use `chi::kAdminPoolId` instead of the client's `pool_id_`. This is because CreateTask is actually a GetOrCreatePoolTask that must be processed by the admin ChiMod to create or find the target pool.

**Correct Usage:**
```cpp
auto task = ipc_manager->NewTask<CreateTask>(
    chi::CreateTaskNode(),
    chi::kAdminPoolId,  // Always use admin pool for CreateTask
    pool_query,
    // ... other parameters
);
```

### Container ID Assignment

When creating pools, **the container ID MUST be set to the node ID** of the physical node where the container is created. This ensures proper routing of DirectHash queries to physical nodes.

**Implementation:**
- `ModuleManager::CreateContainer()` takes a `container_id` parameter
- `PoolManager::CreatePool()` passes `ipc_manager->GetNodeId()` as the container ID
- The container's `container_id_` field is set to the physical node ID

This mapping allows DirectHash to correctly route tasks:
1. Hash value determines container ID: `container_id = hash % num_containers`
2. Container ID maps to physical node ID via the address table
3. Task completer reflects the physical node ID where it executed

### ChiMod Name Parameter
ChiMod clients MUST use `CreateParams::chimod_lib_name` instead of hardcoded module names in CreateTask operations.

### Pool Name Requirements
All ChiMod Create functions MUST require a user-provided `pool_name` parameter. Never auto-generate pool names using `pool_id_` during Create operations, as `pool_id_` is not set until after Create completes.

**Admin Pool Name Requirement:**
The admin pool name MUST always be "admin". Multiple admin pools are NOT supported.

## ChiMod Linking Requirements

### Target Naming and Aliases
ChiMod libraries use consistent underscore-based naming:

**Target Names:**
- Runtime: `${NAMESPACE}_${CHIMOD_NAME}_runtime` (e.g., `chimaera_admin_runtime`)
- Client: `${NAMESPACE}_${CHIMOD_NAME}_client` (e.g., `chimaera_admin_client`)

**CMake Aliases:**
- Runtime: `${NAMESPACE}::${CHIMOD_NAME}_runtime` (e.g., `chimaera::admin_runtime`)
- Client: `${NAMESPACE}::${CHIMOD_NAME}_client` (e.g., `chimaera::admin_client`)

**Package Names:**
- Format: `${NAMESPACE}_${CHIMOD_NAME}` (e.g., `chimaera_admin`)
- Used with `find_package(chimaera_admin REQUIRED)`
- Core package: `chimaera` (provides `chimaera::cxx`)

### Automatic Dependency Linking
ChiMod libraries automatically handle common dependencies:

**Automatic Dependencies for Runtime Code:**
- `rt` library: Automatically linked to all ChiMod runtime targets for POSIX real-time library support (async I/O)
- Admin ChiMod: Automatically linked to all non-admin ChiMod runtime and client targets
- Admin includes: Automatically added to include directories for non-admin ChiMods

**For External Applications:**

Use the unified `find_package(iowarp-core)` which automatically includes all components and ChiMods:

```cmake
# Single find_package call includes everything
find_package(iowarp-core REQUIRED)
# This automatically provides:
#   Core Components:
#     - All hshm::* modular targets (hshm::cxx, hshm::configure, hshm::serialize, etc.)
#     - chimaera::cxx (core runtime library)
#     - ChiMod build utilities (add_chimod_client, add_chimod_runtime, etc.)
#
#   Core ChiMods (Always Available):
#     - chimaera::admin_client, chimaera::admin_runtime
#     - chimaera::bdev_client, chimaera::bdev_runtime
#
#   Optional ChiMods (if enabled at build time):
#     - wrp_cte::core_client, wrp_cte::core_runtime (if WRP_CORE_ENABLE_CTE=ON)
#     - wrp_cae::core_client, wrp_cae::core_runtime (if WRP_CORE_ENABLE_CAE=ON)

# Then link to the ChiMod libraries you need
target_link_libraries(your_target
  chimaera::admin_client     # Admin ChiMod (always available)
  chimaera::bdev_client      # Block device ChiMod (always available)
  wrp_cte::core_client       # CTE ChiMod (if enabled)
  wrp_cae::core_client       # CAE ChiMod (if enabled)
)
# Dependencies are automatically included by ChiMod libraries
# No need to manually link hshm::cxx or chimaera::cxx
```

**Alternative (Manual):**
If you need finer control, you can still find packages individually:
```cmake
find_package(HermesShm REQUIRED)        # Provides hshm::* targets
find_package(chimaera REQUIRED)         # Provides chimaera::cxx
find_package(chimaera_admin REQUIRED)   # Provides admin ChiMod
find_package(chimaera_bdev REQUIRED)    # Provides bdev ChiMod
find_package(wrp_cte_core REQUIRED)     # Provides CTE ChiMod (if enabled)
find_package(wrp_cae_core REQUIRED)     # Provides CAE ChiMod (if enabled)
```

### HSHM Modular Dependency Targets

HSHM (HermesShm/context-transport-primitives) provides modular INTERFACE library targets for optional dependencies. Each target includes only the specific dependency it represents, along with the associated compile definitions.

**Available Modular Targets:**

- **`hshm::cxx`** - Core HSHM library

# External application needing configuration and serialization
target_link_libraries(my_app
  wrp_cte::core_client      # Provides hshm::cxx automatically
  hshm::configure           # For YAML config parsing
  hshm::serialize           # For object serialization

)

# Test needing MPI
target_link_libraries(my_test
  hshm::cxx
  hshm::mpi                 # Only link MPI where needed
)

# GPU application using CUDA
target_link_libraries(my_cuda_kernel
  hshm::cuda_cxx            # For GPU kernel code
)
```

## ChiMod Runtime Code Standards

### Autogenerated Code Duplication
Runtime code (`*_runtime.cc` files) should **NEVER** duplicate autogenerated code methods. The following methods are automatically generated and must not be manually implemented in runtime source files:

**Prohibited duplicate implementations:**
- `SaveIn()` - Serialization from input parameters
- `LoadIn()` - Deserialization to input parameters
- `SaveOut()` - Serialization from output parameters
- `LoadOut()` - Deserialization to output parameters
- `NewCopy()` - Task copy constructor methods (container dispatcher, not task method)
- `Aggregate()` - Task aggregation dispatcher (container dispatcher, not task method)

## Locking and Synchronization

### CoMutex and CoRwLock

The chimaera runtime provides two simplified coroutine-aware synchronization primitives for runtime code:

**CoMutex (Coroutine Mutex)**
- **Header**: `chimaera/comutex.h`
- **Purpose**: Simplified mutex that uses Yield for blocking
- Uses a single `std::atomic<bool>` for lock state
- Tasks that cannot acquire the lock call `Yield()` to be placed in the blocked queue
- Tasks are retried automatically by the blocked queue mechanism
- No complex data structures (no vectors, maps, or lists)

**CoRwLock (Coroutine Reader-Writer Lock)**
- **Header**: `chimaera/corwlock.h`
- **Purpose**: Simplified reader-writer lock that uses Yield for blocking
- Uses `std::atomic<int>` for reader count and `std::atomic<bool>` for writer state
- Supports multiple concurrent readers or a single writer
- Tasks that cannot acquire the lock call `Yield()` to be placed in the blocked queue

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT add any print, log, or HLOG statements in lock acquire or release paths (Lock, Unlock, ReadLock, ReadUnlock, WriteLock, WriteUnlock). Logging in lock paths causes severe performance degradation and can introduce deadlocks when the logging system itself acquires locks.

### Task Wait Functionality

**Critical Fix for Infinite Loops**
The task `Wait()` function has been fixed to prevent infinite loops in the blocked task system. When a task calls `Wait()`, it automatically adds itself to the current task's `waiting_for_tasks` list in `RunContext`.

**Usage:**
```cpp
task->Wait();  // Automatically tracked in parent task's waiting list
task->Wait(false);  // Same as above - explicitly tracked
task->Wait(true);   // Called from yield - not tracked to avoid double tracking
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Compilation Standards
- All code must compile without warnings or errors
- Use appropriate variable types to avoid sign comparison warnings (e.g., `size_t` for container sizes)
- Mark unused variables with `(void)variable_name;` to suppress warnings when the variable is intentionally unused
- Follow strict type safety to prevent implicit conversions that generate warnings

### Thread Safety Standards

**Atomic Task Fields:**
Critical task fields that may be accessed from multiple threads should use atomic types for thread safety:

```cpp
std::atomic<u32> return_code_; /**< Task return code (0=success, non-zero=error) */
```

**Usage:**
- **Reading**: Use `task->GetReturnCode()` or `task->return_code_.load()`
- **Writing**: Use `task->SetReturnCode(value)` or `task->return_code_.store(value)`
- **Initialization**: Use `task->return_code_.store(0)` in constructors

## Unit Testing Standards

### Create Method Success Validation
**CRITICAL**: Always check if Create methods completed successfully in unit tests. Many test failures occur because Create operations fail but tests continue executing against invalid or uninitialized objects.

**Success Criteria**: Create methods succeed when the return code is 0.

**Required Pattern for All Unit Tests:**
```cpp
// After any Create operation in unit tests
ASSERT_EQ(client.GetReturnCode(), 0) << "Create operation failed with return code: " << client.GetReturnCode();

// Or for individual task-based creates
auto create_task = client.AsyncCreate(mctx, pool_query, pool_name, /* other params */);
create_task->Wait();
ASSERT_EQ(create_task->GetReturnCode(), 0) << "Create task failed with return code: " << create_task->GetReturnCode();
```

This requirement applies to ALL ChiMod Create operations in unit tests including admin, bdev, and any custom ChiMods.

### Test Framework Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Unit tests that initialize the Chimaera runtime MUST use the `simple_test.h` framework. **DO NOT use Catch2** with Chimaera runtime initialization.

**Catch2 Incompatibility:**
- Catch2's test framework causes segmentation faults when used with Chimaera runtime initialization
- This issue was confirmed by copying working test code from `test_bdev_chimod.cc` (which uses simple_test.h) to a Catch2-based test - the identical code segfaulted with Catch2 but worked with simple_test.h
- Root cause: Catch2's test runner infrastructure conflicts with Chimaera's runtime initialization

**Required Test Framework:**
- Use `#include "../../../context-runtime/test/simple_test.h"` instead of Catch2
- Available macros: `TEST_CASE`, `SECTION`, `REQUIRE`, `REQUIRE_FALSE`, `REQUIRE_NOTHROW`, `INFO`, `FAIL`
- Use `SIMPLE_TEST_MAIN()` at the end of your test file
- Note: simple_test.h does NOT provide `CHECK` macro - use `REQUIRE` instead

**Example simple_test.h Test:**
```cpp
#include "../../../context-runtime/test/simple_test.h"

TEST_CASE("My Test", "[mytag]") {
  // Test code here
  REQUIRE(some_condition);
}

SIMPLE_TEST_MAIN()
```

### Chimaera Initialization in Unit Tests

**CRITICAL**: All unit tests MUST use the unified `CHIMAERA_INIT()` function. Do NOT use deprecated initialization functions or direct calls to `CHIMAERA_RUNTIME_INIT()` or `CHIMAERA_CLIENT_INIT()`.

**Required Pattern for All Unit Tests:**
```cpp
// At the beginning of your test or test fixture setup
bool success = chi::CHIMAERA_INIT(chi::ChimaeraMode::kClient, true);
REQUIRE(success);

// Optional: Wait for initialization to complete
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500));

// Verify core managers are available
REQUIRE(CHI_IPC != nullptr);
REQUIRE(CHI_IPC->IsInitialized());
```

**Initialization Parameters:**
- **Mode**: Always use `chi::ChimaeraMode::kClient` for unit tests
- **default_with_runtime**: Always use `true` for unit tests (starts runtime automatically)
- **Environment Variable**: `CHI_WITH_RUNTIME` is handled automatically by `CHIMAERA_INIT()`
  - If set to `1`: Runtime will be started
  - If set to `0`: Only client initialization (useful for external runtime scenarios)
  - If not set: Uses the `default_with_runtime` parameter value

**DEPRECATED - Do NOT Use:**
- `initializeBoth()` - Remove from all test fixtures
- `initializeRuntime()` - Remove from all test fixtures
- `initializeClient()` - Remove from all test fixtures
- `chi::CHIMAERA_RUNTIME_INIT()` - Do not call directly in tests
- `chi::CHIMAERA_CLIENT_INIT()` - Do not call directly in tests

**Example Test Fixture:**
```cpp
class MyTestFixture {
public:
  MyTestFixture() {
    // Initialize Chimaera with client mode and runtime
    bool success = chi::CHIMAERA_INIT(chi::ChimaeraMode::kClient, true);
    REQUIRE(success);

    // Give runtime time to initialize
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500));

    // Verify initialization
    REQUIRE(CHI_IPC != nullptr);
    REQUIRE(CHI_POOL_MANAGER != nullptr);
  }

  ~MyTestFixture() {
    // Cleanup handled automatically
  }
};
```

## Device Configuration

### Directory Management
When configuring devices:
- Use `mkdir` to create each parent directory specified in the devices configuration during the configure phase
- Remove each directory during the clean phase to ensure proper cleanup
- This ensures device paths exist before use and are properly cleaned up after

## Docker Deployment

### Overview

The IOWarp Core runtime can be deployed using Docker containers for easy distributed deployment. The Docker setup includes:
- Dockerfile for building the runtime container
- docker-compose.yml for orchestrating multi-node clusters
- Entrypoint script for configuration generation
- Hostfile for cluster node management

### Quick Start

```bash
# Build and start 3-node cluster
cd docker
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f iowarp-node1

# Stop cluster
docker-compose down
```

### Configuration Methods

**Method 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)**

Configure via environment variables in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
environment:
  - CHI_SCHED_WORKERS=8
  - CHI_MAIN_SEGMENT_SIZE=1G
  - CHI_CLIENT_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE=512M
  - CHI_RUNTIME_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE=512M
  - CHI_PORT=9413              # Override RPC port (default: 9413)
  - CHI_SERVER_ADDR=127.0.0.1 # Override server address for clients
  - CHI_IPC_MODE=TCP          # SHM, TCP (default), or IPC
  - CHI_LOG_LEVEL=info
  - CHI_SHM_SIZE=2147483648
```

### Critical Requirements

**Shared Memory Size:**
**CRITICAL**: Set `shm_size` >= sum of all segment sizes:
```yaml
shm_size: 2gb  # Must be >= main + client_data + runtime_data segments
```

**Hostfile:**
Create hostfile with cluster node IPs (one per line):
```
172.20.0.10
172.20.0.11
172.20.0.12
```

Mount in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./hostfile:/etc/iowarp/hostfile:ro
environment:
  - CHI_HOSTFILE=/etc/iowarp/hostfile
```

## IPC Transport Modes

Chimaera clients communicate with the runtime server using one of three IPC transport modes, controlled by the `CHI_IPC_MODE` environment variable. This variable is read during `IpcManager::ClientInit()`.

**Values:**

| Value | Mode | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `SHM` / `shm` | Shared Memory | Client attaches to the server's shared memory queues and pushes tasks directly. Lowest latency, requires same-machine access to the server's shared memory segment. |
| `TCP` / `tcp` | TCP (ZeroMQ) | Client sends serialized tasks over TCP via lightbeam PUSH/PULL sockets. Works across machines. **This is the default when `CHI_IPC_MODE` is unset.** |
| `IPC` / `ipc` | Unix Domain Socket (ZeroMQ) | Client sends serialized tasks over a Unix domain socket via lightbeam PUSH/PULL. Same-machine only, avoids TCP overhead. |

**Bulk data handling:**
- In SHM mode, `bulk()` serialization writes the `ShmPtr` (allocator ID + offset) since both client and server can resolve shared memory pointers.
- In TCP/IPC mode, buffers are allocated with null `alloc_id_` (private memory). `bulk()` detects null `alloc_id_` and inlines the actual data bytes into the serialization stream.

**Example:**
```bash
# Use shared memory transport (same machine, lowest latency)
export CHI_IPC_MODE=SHM

# Use TCP transport (default, works across machines)
export CHI_IPC_MODE=TCP

# Use Unix domain socket transport (same machine, no TCP overhead)
export CHI_IPC_MODE=IPC
```

## Python Wheel Distribution

### Building Bundled Wheels

IOWarp Core can be packaged as a self-contained Python wheel that includes all dependencies installed by `install.sh`.

**Quick Build:**
```bash
# Build a bundled wheel with all dependencies
export IOWARP_BUNDLE_BINARIES=ON
python -m build --wheel

# Or use the convenience script
./build_wheel.sh
```

**What Gets Bundled:**
- All IOWarp libraries (libchimaera_cxx.so, libhermes_shm_host.so, ChiMod libraries)
- Dependencies from install.sh (Boost, HDF5, ZeroMQ, yaml-cpp, etc.)
- Command-line tools (wrp_cte, wrp_cae_omni, chimaera, etc.)
- Headers and CMake configuration files
- Conda dependencies (if building in a Conda environment)

**RPATH Configuration:**
- All bundled libraries use relative RPATH (`$ORIGIN`)
- The wheel is fully relocatable and works anywhere it's installed
- No `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` configuration needed

**Complete Documentation:** See `BUILD_WHEEL.md` for:
- Detailed build instructions
- Platform-specific wheels (manylinux, macOS)
- CI/CD integration examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- PyPI distribution

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **clio-core** (21062 symbols, 41201 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
