/**
 * IOWarp Weight Manager for llama.cpp (FlexGen-style offloading)
 *
 * Uses IOWarp's GpuVirtualMemoryManager to create a single large CUDA
 * virtual address space (512 GB by default) backed by:
 *   1. GPU HBM     — pages that are currently mapped / in active use
 *   2. CPU DRAM    — pages evicted from GPU (GpuVmm host backing store)
 *   3. NVMe SSD    — pages evicted from CPU DRAM (via CTE when use_cte=true)
 *
 * During inference, layers are processed sequentially.  WeightManager
 * pre-loads the next layer's pages while the current layer computes,
 * then evicts the previous layer's pages — providing an overlapped
 * compute/transfer pipeline analogous to FlexGen.
 *
 * Integration with llama.cpp:
 *   - The ggml_iowarp_backend (see ggml_iowarp_backend.h) allocates model
 *     weight tensors inside this virtual address space.
 *   - Before each transformer layer, PrepareLayer(layer_idx) is called to
 *     guarantee all pages are mapped.
 *   - After each layer, ReleaseLayer(layer_idx) evicts pages back to host.
